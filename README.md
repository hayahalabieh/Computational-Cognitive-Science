# Computational-Cognitive-Science

Learning about modeling cognitive science with python, I embarked on the following:

Using the Hudgkin-Huxley model of action potentials to design a computational model of action potentials. This includes visualizing an action potential with voltage. 

Manipulating the model to represent monopole and dipole neurons.
